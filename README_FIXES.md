# Video Generation UI Fixes

## Problem Summary
The original implementation had a timeout issue where:
- UI showed "Failed: HTTP 524" error
- Backend was successfully generating videos (as seen in logs)
- No second step to display the generated video

## Root Cause
The video generation process takes several minutes, but the HTTP request was timing out before completion, causing the UI to show an error even though the video was being generated successfully.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Asynchronous Video Generation
- Modified the FastAPI backend to use background tasks
- Video generation now runs asynchronously without blocking the HTTP request
- Added job status tracking with unique job IDs

### 2. New API Endpoints
- `POST /generate` - Starts video generation and returns a job ID
- `GET /status/{job_id}` - Checks the status of a video generation job
- `GET /download` - Downloads the completed video (unchanged)

### 3. Enhanced UI
- Added status polling to check generation progress
- Improved loading states with progress messages
- The second step (video preview) now works correctly
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified

### Backend (`fastapi_app.py`)
- Added background task processing
- Implemented job status tracking
- Added new response models for async operations

### Frontend (`ui/main.js`)
- Added status polling mechanism
- Enhanced loading states
- Improved error handling
- Fixed video preview functionality

### Configuration (`ui/config.js`)
- Created configuration file for API endpoint
- Easy to update for different environments

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Generate Video"**
   - UI sends request to `/generate` endpoint
   - Backend starts background video generation
   - Returns job ID immediately (no timeout)

2. **Status Polling**
   - UI polls `/status/{job_id}` every 2 seconds
   - Shows progress messages: "Queued" → "Generating" → "Completed"
   - No more timeout errors

3. **Video Display**
   - When generation completes, UI automatically shows step 2
   - Video preview loads and displays the generated video
   - Download link is available

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the API:
```bash
python test_api.py
```

## Configuration

Update `ui/config.js` with your RunPod endpoint:
```javascript
window.config = {
    API_BASE: "https://your-runpod-host:8888",
    API_KEY: "your-api-key-if-needed"
};
```

## Benefits

- ✅ No more timeout errors
- ✅ Real-time progress feedback
- ✅ Proper video preview functionality
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Scalable architecture for multiple concurrent generations
